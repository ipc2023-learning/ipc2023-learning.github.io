==============================================================================

We are delighted to announce the International Conference on Planning and
Scheduling (ICAPS) 2023 in Prague will host a next iteration of the
International Planning Competition (IPC). It empirically evaluates
state-of-the-art planning systems on a number of benchmark problems. The goals
of the IPC are to promote planning research, highlight challenges in the
planning community, and provide new and interesting problems as benchmarks for
future research.

If you would like to design a domain for the competition please contact us as
soon as possible (ipc2023@googlegroups.com). We will collaborate in adapting
the domains to suit the IPC, but we ask you to think about the ability to
easily scale problem difficulty. If you don't have a domain yourself, but you
can think of someone who might have an interesting planning problem, please
share this call with them.

While not necessary, it is desirable for the domains to be related to real
applications. Moreover, if a domain-dependent planner for the submitted domain
is available, please include it in the submission.

We will consider all submissions and select the highest quality subset to be
included. We are aware that participants that submit a domain that is used
have some advantage with respect to performance on that domain. We view this
as a good incentive for teams to submit high quality proposals.

Following in the steps of the last IPC, we will select one domain for the
Outstanding Domain Submission Award. The evaluation of the submitted domains
will be based mainly on the following criteria:
 - does the domain model a real world application,
 - does it come with a generator with controllable difficulty,
 - does it have an interesting intrinsic difficulty (i.e., it is not a simple
   problem scaled up),
 - does it come with a way to find optimal solutions (e.g., a domain-specific
   solver, or a generator that can create the optimal solutions as well).

As one of the goals of the IPC is to provide a new (publicly available)
set of benchmarks for future research, we plan to publish all domains
selected for IPC 2023 in a public repository. By submitting a domain,
you agree to this and give us the rights to do so. We recommend that you
also license your domain under a permissive license such as CC-0 so
that others can use and build on your domain.

If you have a domain in mind but have doubts whether it would be appropriate
for the IPC, don't hesitate to contact us!
